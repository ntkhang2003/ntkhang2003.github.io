Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Khang, Data Scientist Intern at [FPT Telecom](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fpt-telecom/"). I'm pursuing Bachelor's Degree on Computer Science at [University of Information Technology - VNUHCM](https://www.uit.edu.vn/) (graduate in June 2025).

I attended as a mentee in [Sudo Code 2024](https://sudocode.wtmhcmc.com/), where I learn about Data Scientist NLP and contribute on final project which is Customer Service Chatbot. Besides, I'm doing research on Computer Vision with Image Cropping topic and planning to publish paper in early 2025.

I recently work as a Data Scientist and RnD Engineer skilled in data analysis, machine learning, and AI-driven solutions.
